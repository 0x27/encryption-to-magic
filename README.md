encryption to magic
-----

This plugin for Chrome replaces instances of 'encryption' with the word 'magic' [as suggested by @ciphpercoder](https://twitter.com/CiPHPerCoder/status/711620754010480640)

Also referring to [Chris's tweet](https://twitter.com/csoghoian/status/711619683997323264) for context

It is forked from ['Cloud to Butt'](https://github.com/panicsteve/cloud-to-butt) and likely has bugs.
